# Frontend Mentor - Order summary card solution

This is a solution to the [Order summary card challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/order-summary-component-QlPmajDUj). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for interactive elements


## My process

1° I made a First Mobile model.

2 From top to bottom in applied flex because the project is relatively simple. It was not necessary at least for me to use the Css Grid.

3° Once I did the layout in First Mobile, I passed it to Desktop and with just a few lines of code I was able to achieve a good result.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

More than learning is reviewing what has been studied :)

### Continued development

Not for the moment
